Ambition,Search millions of jobs near you.,"1. Specify Job Preferences: Start by thinking about what kind of job you're looking for. This could include factors like the job title, industry, level of seniority, and location.

2. Submit Your Request: Once you have an idea of what you're looking for, you can ask the system to find matching jobs. For example, you might say something like ""Find software engineering jobs in San Francisco.""

3. Review the Results: The system will then present you with a list of jobs that match your criteria. Each result will include the job title, the hiring company, the location, the compensation, a URL for more details, and a brief description of the job.

4. Ask for More Details: If you're interested in a particular job and want more information, you can ask the system for more details. You might say, for example, ""Tell me more about the first job on the list.""

5. Visit the Job Page: For the most complete and up-to-date information about a job, you can visit the job page. Just follow the URL provided with each job listing.

6. Adjust Your Search: If you don't find what you're looking for, try adjusting your search criteria. Be as specific as possible to get the most relevant results.

Remember, the goal of the Ambition plugin is to help you find relevant jobs. It pulls from real job postings, so if no jobs match your criteria, it won't make up results.

Vivian Health,Take the first step to finding your next healthcare job.,"As an end user, to take advantage of the Vivian Health GPT Plugin, you need to interact with the GPT model in a conversational manner and provide the following information, one category at a time:

Job Periodicity: Specify the type of job you're looking for. Options include travel, permanent, per diem, local contract, or locum jobs.

Job Location: Mention the locations where you're interested in working. Make sure to include both the city and state for each location.

Job Specialty: Let the assistant know your medical specialty or the area in which you wish to work.

Job Pay: Share your desired pay amount and pay period (e.g., ""I want to earn $3000 per week"").

This information is collected through a natural, conversational exchange rather than through a list of questions. The assistant will ask you each question one at a time, and you can provide multiple answers for each question if needed.

After collecting this information, the assistant will use the Vivian Health Plugin to find job opportunities that align with your specified criteria. The assistant will then provide you with the most relevant job suggestions based on your answers.

When you find a job or jobs that you're interested in, the assistant will provide a link, which you can click to apply for the job(s) on the vivian.com website.",hello@vivian.com,hello@vivian.com,www.vivian.com
